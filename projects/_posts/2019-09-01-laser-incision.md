Lasers are used in an increasingly number of surgical specialties to precisely cut and ablate tissue. Surgical lasers present a number of operational parameters -including beam intensity, number and frequency of pulses, etc. - that are not always intuitive to control. We are working on a technology that automatically regulates these parameters based on high-level inputs from the surgeon - e.g. "I wish to make an incision 1 mm deep". In prior studies, we demonstrated that automating laser incisions enables sub-millimeter accuracy, something that only a small number of exceptional surgeons can currently achieve using microscopes and hand-aimed laser systems.

Our approach uses a controller based on a model that maps the desired ablation depth to the required laser parameters (power, pulse duration, exposure time). Building such a model would normally involve solving the differential equations that govern laser-tissue interactions, but these are generally difficult to solve in closed form and even numerical solutions require many assumptions that cannot be made with high confidence in a realistic surgical setting. In contrast, our approach involves learning the mapping through repeated observations - just like humans do. Supervised machine learning enables the creation of models that capture and reproduce the surgeonâ€™s mental estimation of the laser incision depth, i.e. models capable of mapping the laser inputs to the resulting depth.
