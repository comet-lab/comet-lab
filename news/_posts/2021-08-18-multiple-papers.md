[Nick] got a paper accepted in the Journal of Medical Robotics Research. The manuscript
is entitled _Beyond Constant Curvature: A New Mechanics Model for Unidirectional Notched-Tube Continuum Wrists_.

Dr. Fichera co-authored an article entitled _Trans-eustachian Middle Ear Endoscopy Using a Steerable Distal-Camera Tipped Endoscope_, which will appear in a forthcoming issue of _Otology and Neurotology_.

Our group got a paper accepted at IEEE EMBC 2021. The paper is entitled _Optical Fiber Coupling System for Steerable Endoscopic Instruments_, and it is a collaboration with Prof. Yuxiang Liu's laboratory at WPI.

We also posted a pre-print on arXiv entitled [_Identification of Tissue Optical Properties During Thermal Laser-Tissue Interactions: Approach and Preliminary Evaluation_][1]. This project is in collaboration with
Prof. Andrea Arnold (WPI).
