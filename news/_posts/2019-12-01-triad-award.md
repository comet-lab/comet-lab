Our laboratory was awarded a $60k [TRIAD seed grant][1] from WPI for the proposal entitled
"Photoacoustic Imaging of Neurovascular Bundles for Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Pelvic Surgery."
The goal of this 1-year project, which will be carried out in collaboration with
Profs. Kai Zhang, Greg Fischer, and Ben Nephew, is to explore the creation of a
spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging system to aid in the detection of neurovascular bundles
(NVBs) during robot-assisted pelvic surgical procedures, including radical prostatectomies.
