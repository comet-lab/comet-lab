My name is Rositsa Mihaleva and I am a Biomedical Engineering student of the Class of 2022 with minors in Mechanical Engineering and Spanish. On campus you'll find me giving tours or performing in various musical and theatrical productions at WPI. My vocal cords are particularly dear to me due to singing, and I am excited to work with the interdisciplinary team in the Comet Lab on the SCREAM project which targets vocal cord diseases.
