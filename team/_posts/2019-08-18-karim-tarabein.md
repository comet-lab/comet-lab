Son of a Doctor and Dentist, Karim had noticed at the ripe age of 5 that the medical tools used by physicians were limited. His family mistook his interest in medical technology as a sign he was to become a great surgeon. They were quick to forget the disappointment of finding out he was not planning to become a physician and instead are proud of his accomplishments in medical devices. Holding 2 degrees from University of Alabama at Birmingham and a Masters of Science in Biomedical Engineering from WPI, Karim has taken an interest in surgical robotics applications, particularly in performing tasks that most humans find difficult, and shortening the learning curve for certain procedures. He is doing his Thesis on laser surgical robotics with Dr. Fichera. In his spare time, he enjoys surfing.

If you would like to reach out to ask questions about projects, industry, or just talk about new cool technologies, he is always open to individuals reaching out via wpi email.
