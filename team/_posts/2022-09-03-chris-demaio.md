I am a robotics engineering student at WPI pursuing a BS/MS. I am excited to work on technology that will make a positive impact on our society. Outside of class, I am a Student Assistant for RBE 2001 and 2002, and I am the president of Rho Beta Epsilon, the robotics engineering honor society. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, baking, and playing soccer.
