My name is Jackie and I am a senior at WPI majoring in Robotics Engineering. On campus you'll find me as a Residential Advisor, the Chapter Life Vice President of Alpha Xi Delta, and as the PR chair for Women in Robotics Engineering (WiRE). I'm excited to work on the SCREAM5 project since it will allow me to pursue my passion for robotics from the perspective of the medical industry.
