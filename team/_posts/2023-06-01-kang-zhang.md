Hello!
I'm Kang Zhang, a passionate junior at WPI, majoring in Robotics. My goal is to become a skilled roboticist and make a positive impact on the world, with a particular focus on the field of medical robotics. In my free time, you'll find me engrossed in video games or channeling my creativity into building woodcrafts.
