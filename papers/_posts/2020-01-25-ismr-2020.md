# Abstract

This  paper  presents  a  computational  framework to  optimize  the  visual  coverage  attainable  by  a  notched-tube continuum robotic endoscope inside the middle ear cavity. Our framework  combines  anatomically-accurate  geometric  (mesh)models  of  the  middle  ear  with  a  sampling-based  motion  planning algorithm (RRT) and a ray-casting procedure to quantify what regions of the middle ear can be accessed and visualized by  the  endoscope.  To  demonstrate  the  use  of  this  framework, we run computer simulations to investigate the effect of varying the distance between each pair of consecutive flexure elements(i.e.,  notches)  in  our  robotic  endoscope.
