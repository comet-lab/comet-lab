# Abstract
This paper reports on a study whose goal is to
control the tissue temperature at a specific spot during laser
surgery, for the purpose of, e.g., inducing coagulation or sealing
blood vessels. We propose a solution that relies on the automatic
adjustment of the laser focus (and thus how concentrated the
laser beam is), combined with the use of an infrared thermal
camera for non-contact temperature monitoring. One of the
main challenges in the control of thermal laser-tissue interactions
is that these interactions can be hard to predict due to the
inherent variability in the molecular composition of biological
tissue. To tackle this challenge, we explore two different control
approaches: (1) a model-less controller using a Proportional-
Integral (PI) formulation, whose gains are set via a tuning
procedure performed on laboratory-made tissue phantoms; and
(2) a model-based controller using an adaptive formulation that
makes it robust to tissue variability. We report on experiments,
performed on four types of tissue specimens, showing that both
controllers can consistently achieve temperature tracking with a
Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) ≈ 1 ◦C
