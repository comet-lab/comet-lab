# Abstract
Tonsillectomy, one of the most common surgical procedures worldwide, is often associated with postoperative complications, particularly bleeding. Tonsil laser ablation has been proposed as a safer alternative; however, its adoption has been limited because it can be difficult for a surgeon to visually control the thermal interactions that occur between the laser and the tissue. In this study, we propose to monitor the ablation caused by a CO2 laser on ex-vivo tonsil tissue using photoacoustic imaging. Soft tissueâ€™s unique photoacoustic spectra were used to distinguish between ablated and non-ablated tissue. Our results suggest that photoacoustic imaging is able to visualize necrosis formation and calculate the necrotic extent, offering the potential for improved tonsil laser ablation outcomes.
