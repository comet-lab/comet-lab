# Abstract
In this paper, we present a study on the viability of fabricating Concentric Tube Robots using Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) of Nylon-12, a type of elastic polymer commonly used in additive manufacturing. We note that Nylon-12 was already evaluated for the purpose of building CTRs in prior work, but fabrication was performed with Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), which produced unsatisfactory results. Our study is the first study to evaluate the suitability of MJF to 3D-print CTRs.
