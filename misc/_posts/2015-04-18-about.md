# Joining the lab
__The COMET Lab is seeking new graduate students!__  
If you are interested in joining the lab, please email Prof. Fichera with your CV and a brief statement of what most interests you about our research. Prospective graduate students should apply through the WPI Robotics Engineering Graduate Program. In your statement of purpose, mention that you are interested in the COMET Lab and discuss how your research interests align with those of the lab. If you have a fellowship support, please be sure to mention it as well in the email.  

__Undergraduate Students__  
Current WPI undergraduate students with an interest in medical robotics are encouraged to contact Prof. Fichera directly by email or in person to talk about research ideas. There are a number of ways to get involved in our lab's research, including MQPs, ISPs, etc.

# Design and Implementation

I was inspired by [Trevor Bedford]'s clean, elegant, and functional [site][1]. More than inspired--I've copied many aspects of his site, from visual design to conceptual organization to under-the-hood code, at Trevor's ([public]) invitation. Rather than branching his code, I started from a different boilerplate, and adopted/adapted bits of his code during customization.

The site started with [Jekyll Bootstrap], and was up and running in a weekend. The site is deployed using [GitHub Pages], which combines source-code control and hosting in a most pleasant way. Modify, test locally, push, and it's live.

Keeping with a major Jekyll Bootstrap idea, the site separates content and presentation. Presentation information is stored in a new theme, the `lab` theme, which may be useful to other research groups setting up sites.

By using [Sass] for stylesheets, the site gets virtually all the advantages of using [Less], while exploiting native Sass support in [GitHub Pages]. The site uses [Google Fonts] as well, primarily [Open Sans].

The site's source code is freely available on [GitHub]. All code is placed under the MIT license. You're welcome to borrow / repurpose code to build your own site, and if you do, I'd appreciate attribution and a link back [here](http://drummondlab.org/about.html).
